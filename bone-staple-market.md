<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Staple Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable Bone Staple</li><li>Absorbable Bone Staple</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone staple market is categorized into non-absorbable and absorbable bone staples. Non-absorbable bone staples are made from materials that remain in the body indefinitely, providing long-term stability for bone fixation and often used in orthopedic surgeries. Absorbable bone staples, on the other hand, are designed to dissolve over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove them. This type is beneficial for temporary support during healing, reducing the risk of complications associated with permanent implants.</p></p>
