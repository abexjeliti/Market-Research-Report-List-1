<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tactical Fiber Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tactical fiber cable market is categorized into single-mode and multi-mode fibers, each serving distinct applications. Single-mode fiber features a smaller core diameter, allowing light to travel straight down the fiber, which results in lower attenuation and longer transmission distancesâ€”ideal for long-range communication. In contrast, multi-mode fiber has a larger core, permitting multiple light paths, making it suitable for shorter distances and higher data rates within local networks. Both types are crucial for military, industrial, and emergency communications.</p></p>
