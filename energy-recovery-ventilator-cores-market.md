<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Recovery Ventilator Cores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crossflow</li><li>Counter-flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) cores come in two main types: crossflow and counter-flow. Crossflow cores allow air streams to pass perpendicular to each other, enabling heat exchange but with minimal moisture transfer. This design is simpler and often more compact. In contrast, counter-flow cores feature air streams flowing parallel to each other, maximizing heat and moisture transfer efficiency. This configuration generally provides better energy recovery but can be bulkier. Both types are essential for improving indoor air quality and energy efficiency in buildings.</p></p>
