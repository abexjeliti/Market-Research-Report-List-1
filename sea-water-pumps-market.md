<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sea Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sea water pumps market comprises mainly two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move seawater, making them efficient for high-flow applications, such as cooling systems and aquaculture. In contrast, positive displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed volume of seawater and forcing it through the discharge, making them ideal for high-pressure applications like desalination and chemical transfer. Each type serves distinct needs based on flow rates and pressure requirements in marine environments.</p></p>
